Todoist Website Test Code Check
Description
This project involves performing functional and non-functional testing on the Todoist website. The tests are conducted to ensure the proper functioning and performance of the website under various conditions. The project also includes running the code in multiple browsers and leveraging Selenium Grid to distribute test execution across different nodes.

Testing
Functional Testing
Functional testing involves verifying that the Todoist website's features and functionalities work as expected. This includes testing tasks such as creating new tasks, editing existing tasks, setting reminders, and managing projects and labels.

Non-Functional Testing
Non-functional testing focuses on aspects like performance, usability, security, and compatibility. Performance testing ensures that the website responds quickly and efficiently under different load conditions. Usability testing assesses the user-friendliness of the interface. Security testing checks for vulnerabilities and ensures data privacy. Compatibility testing ensures that the website works correctly across different browsers and devices.

Multi-Browser Testing
The project involves running the test code in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility. This ensures that the Todoist website functions correctly regardless of the browser used by the end user.

Selenium Grid
Selenium Grid is used to distribute test execution across multiple nodes, allowing for parallel execution of tests. This improves efficiency and reduces the overall test execution time
